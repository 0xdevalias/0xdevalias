### About Glenn 'devalias' Grant

Glenn is a full-stack, polyglot developer with an acute interest in the offensive side of security. Whether building something new or finding the cracks to break in, there is always a solution to be found; even if it requires learning something entirely new. If you can improve/automate something, do it, and if you've put the effort in to do so, open-source it and share it with everyone else.

When not hacking and coding, Glenn can be found snowboarding the peaks of Japan, cruising on his longboard, floating around underwater, or just finding the most efficient path between A and B (even if that's over walls). Life is short. Do the things you love, embrace the unknown, live your dreams, and share your passion.

I primarily write about things on my [Blog](https://www.devalias.net/), though sometimes I will also post on [Medium](https://medium.com/@devalias), [LinkedIn Articles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glenn-devalias-grant/detail/recent-activity/posts/), and similar places.

I have presented at a few security conferences and meetups, which I tend to keep track of [on my blog](https://www.devalias.net/speaker/) and in [0xdevalias/presentations](https://github.com/0xdevalias/presentations). You can also usally find my slides on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/0xdevalias) and/or [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/GlenndevaliasGrant).

I like to solve problems, and tend to be quite active on [GitHub](https://github.com/0xdevalias) providing solutions/details for the issues I come across while working on projects.

I also like to contribute answers on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1137085/glenn-devalias) / [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/users/1156663/devalias?tab=activity) when I run into a common problem that I have managed to solve.
